\en-abstract{
Due to the lack of temporal information in a still image, utilizing conventional video processing methods for human action recognition is not feasible, posing numerous challenges. To address the absence of temporal information, focusing on the peripheral information in the image and background proves effective. Extracting information such as human appearance, gestures, and objects related to humans can be achieved from a still image. The physical appearance of humans, poses, and human-related objects contain crucial information about human activities. Nowadays, deep neural networks are commonly employed for extracting these features. Another network, known as Transformer, initially used in text processing applications, is now extensively applied in computer vision and can be beneficial in our context. In this thesis, using Deep Neural Networks, essential image features are first extracted. Subsequently, these features are combined using a Transformer network to establish a relational understanding. The relationship between humans and poses, as well as the relationship between humans and relevant objects, is identified. The network then estimates actions based on the established relational information. The VOC and Stanford40 datasets in the field of human action recognition are utilized for evaluating the model's performance and network training.
